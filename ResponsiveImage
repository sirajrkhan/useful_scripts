# was looking for a 'non-hack' solution for responsive images,
# Saw Chris Coyier prefering SRCSET over PICTURE element-- felt nice as i have been doing so too :)
# https://css-tricks.com/responsive-images-youre-just-changing-resolutions-use-srcset/

# In <picture> we need to do the hard task of DPR and all..
<picture>
    <source media="(min-width: 40em)" srcset="img_big.jpg 1x, img_big-hd.jpg 2x">
    <source srcset="img_small.jpg 1x, img_hd.jpg 2x">
    <img src="img_fallback.jpg" alt="">
</picture>

#In SRCSET it takes care of it, all by itself..
    <img src="small.jpg" srcset="medium.jpg 900w, large.jpg 1200w">
